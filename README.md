# React Digital Business Card

## Project Description

This project is a basic React Travel Journal developed as part of the learning journey on Scrimba. The goal was to apply and reinforce several key React concepts recently acquired, including:

*Destructuring Props: Utilized the destructuring of props to efficiently extract and use specific data within React components.

*Passing Props as Objects: Practiced passing props as objects to components, enabling a cleaner and more organized approach to data transfer between parent and child components.

*Mapping Data to Components: Explored the mapping of data to components, a fundamental skill in React development, to dynamically render multiple entries in the travel journal.

*CSS Styling from Figma Template: Applied CSS skills to recreate the project's layout based on a provided template in Figma. This involved styling components, aligning elements, and ensuring a visually appealing presentation.

Through the development of this Travel Journal project, I gained hands-on experience in React fundamentals and enhanced my proficiency in applying these concepts to build functional and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. The project serves as a valuable showcase of my React development skills and commitment to continuous learning in web development.
